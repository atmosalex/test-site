## PRIOR EXPERIENCE
### 06/21 - 11/22  Postdoctoral Researcher, British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK
> Implemented the BAS-PRO proton belt model in real-time, deployed at the UK Met Office as part of the Sat-Risk forecasting project using a Docker environment. Includes real-time data-driven outer boundary condition derived from INTEGRAL satellite data.
### 09/15 - 01/17  Ground Systems Engineer, Avanti Comms., London & Goonhilly Earth Station, UK

## SKILLS
Machine learning for time series prediction; numerical modeling (i.e. implicit 3D Fokker-Planck); excellent writing and communication; processing spacecraft datasets; and scientific peer review.
